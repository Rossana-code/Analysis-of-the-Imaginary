# analysis_characters

This is my contribution to a project called "Analysis of the Imaginary" led by Data4Good for the French association "Observatoire de l'Imaginaire". The dataset is the result of a survey about how people perceive the representation of ecological and social issues in movies and series. This exploratory data analysis (EDA) is just a part of it, and the entire project will be hosted on a Streamlit website in the future.

Even though the comments are in English, the survey is in French, and so are the visualizations. I found the last heatmaps that correlate gender and ethnicity with the importance of the characters to be really interesting.
